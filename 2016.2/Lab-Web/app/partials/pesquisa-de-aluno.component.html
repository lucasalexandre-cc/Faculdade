<!--
As the user types in the search box, a keyup event binding calls the component's search method with the new
search box value. The *ngFor repeats aluno objects from the component's alunos property. No surprise there.
But, as we'll soon see, the alunos property is now an Observable of aluno arrays, rather than just a aluno
array. The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable until we flow it through the async pipe (AsyncPipe).
The async pipe subscribes to the Observable and produces the array of alunos to *ngFor.
